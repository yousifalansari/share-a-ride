## Overview  
Share-A-Ride is a Node.js web application built with Express and MongoDB. It enables local community members to share rides by allowing drivers to create ride offers and passengers to book seats on those rides. The platform features secure session-based authentication, full CRUD functionality on rides, bookings, and reviews, and ensures authorization so only authenticated users can modify data. Its design encourages eco-friendly transportation and fosters trust through ride ratings and reviews.
