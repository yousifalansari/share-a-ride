## Overview  
Share-A-Ride is a practical web application designed to help local community members share rides efficiently and securely. Drivers can create ride offers by providing key details like origin, destination, date, time, and available seats. Passengers can browse, search, and book seats on rides that fit their schedules. The platform promotes eco-friendly transportation and cost savings by facilitating simple, reliable ride sharing without complexity.

The app focuses on ease of use with clear workflows and secure session-based authentication. Users manage their rides, bookings, and reviews through an intuitive interface that encourages participation and trust.
